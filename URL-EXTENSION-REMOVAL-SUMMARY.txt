✓ URL EXTENSION REMOVAL - COMPLETE

==================================================
WHAT WAS DONE:
==================================================

1. UPDATED .HTACCESS (URL REWRITING)
   Location: c:\Users\inzra\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\seo\.htaccess
   
   Added URL rewriting rules that:
   • Redirect URLs with .html extension to clean URLs (301 redirect)
   • Example: /about.html → /about
   • Internally rewrite clean URLs to .html files
   
   This allows users to visit:
   - https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/about (instead of /about.html)
   - https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/services (instead of /services.html)
   - etc.

2. UPDATED ALL HTML FILES (22 FILES)
   Replaced all internal links from href="page.html" to href="page"
   
   Files updated:
   ✓ about.html
   ✓ ai-seo.html
   ✓ best-seo-company-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ blog.html
   ✓ contact.html
   ✓ faq.html
   ✓ how-long-does-seo-take.html
   ✓ how-to-become-seo-specialist.html
   ✓ index.html
   ✓ pricing.html
   ✓ seo-agency-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ seo-expert-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ seo-price-in-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ seo-service-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ seo-specialist-guide-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ seo-specialist-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ seo-sri-lanka.html
   ✓ services.html
   ✓ single-blog.html
   ✓ what-does-seo-stand-for.html
   ✓ what-is-seo.html

3. SITEMAP (ALREADY CORRECT)
   Location: c:\Users\inzra\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\seo\sitemap.xml
   
   Status: Already in correct format without .html extensions
   Examples:
   - https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/about
   - https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/services
   - https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/faq
   etc.

==================================================
EXAMPLE CHANGES:
==================================================

BEFORE (in HTML files):
  <a href="about.html">About Us</a>
  <a href="services.html">Services</a>
  <a href="pricing.html">Pricing</a>

AFTER (updated):
  <a href="about">About Us</a>
  <a href="services">Services</a>
  <a href="pricing">Pricing</a>

WHAT USERS WILL SEE:
  https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/about
  https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/services
  https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/pricing
  (instead of /about.html, /services.html, /pricing.html)

==================================================
DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
==================================================

1. Upload all updated HTML files to cPanel /public_html/
2. Make sure the .htaccess file is uploaded to /public_html/
3. Verify URL rewriting is enabled in cPanel (usually enabled by default)
4. Test URLs:
   - Visit https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/about (should work)
   - Visit https://seoconsultantsrilanka.com/about.html (should redirect to /about)
5. Update Google Search Console with new clean URLs

==================================================
BENEFITS:
==================================================

✓ Cleaner, more professional URLs
✓ Better for SEO (search engines prefer clean URLs)
✓ Matches sitemap format (no .html extensions)
✓ Better user experience (easier to remember)
✓ 301 redirects ensure old links don't break

==================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES:
==================================================

• The .htaccess file uses RewriteEngine which requires mod_rewrite
• Most cPanel hosting has this enabled by default
• If URLs don't work after deployment, check if mod_rewrite is enabled
• The 301 redirect ensures any old .html links will redirect to clean URLs
• Both old and new URLs will work, but new ones are preferred
